# Notes on performing

## Performing tracks

- expose some key areas as variables to tweak
- transitions transitions transitions
- practice practice practice

## Improvisation

- know your sample library (or MIDI device) inside and out
- shortcuts shortcuts shortcuts
  - code should be as CONCISE as possible
  - typing time should be spent evolving and changing sound, not on syntax [1]
- practice practice practice

So many philosophies...  guardrails, learning as you perform, etc.

Command of your environment.
